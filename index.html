<h1>Introduction to programming Nano degree</h1><br>
<h2>1st assignment: Make your First (very simple) Web Page</h2> 
<p><br><br><em>Unit 1: Introduction to web</em><br>After the first unit we are familiar with concepts such the web, html, urls and web applications. We know how I, my computer (browser), the internet, http and servers are connected to each other.<br><br>We are also familiar with  basic html markups. We have learned how to edit text and how to add images and urls to our website.</p>
<p><em><b>HTML</b></em><br>is made of text content (what you see)<br>markup (what it looks like)<br>references to other documents (for example images and videos)<br>links to other pages<br><br><em>HTML markup</em><br>One element consists of an opening tag, contents and a closing tag.<br><br><em>HTML attribute</em><br>consists of tag attr=value, contents and closing tag.<br>A good example is a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-Hyperlink-with-HTML">hyperlink.</a><br><br><em>Images</em><br>
<img src="http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/283048/283048,1284913689,1/stock-photo-very-happy-black-dog-sitting-on-green-grass-61283164.jpg."><br>Images don't have closing tag.<br><br>
  <em><b>White space</b></em><br>Text can be folded in multiple lines with break and paragraph tags.<em><br><br>Inline vs.block</em><br>br, img, span and a are inline elements. p, div are block elements. </p>
<p>And as I have now proved, this all was very valuable information. I created my very first web page. I found a giphy called coding for the bacground and added a hyperlink and even a picture of a cute dog!<br>
